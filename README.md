# karate-website-archived
This was the website I built for my sensei's karate dojo. The site is now archived.

The dojo had to be closed due to the head instructor's surgery/health concerns and his need to focus on his recovery.

He still actively trains, teaches, and promotes martial arts events.

I was an assistant instructor for his karate program as well as the webmaster.
