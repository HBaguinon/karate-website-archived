Master Irv's Personal Philosophy</b> </p>
<p class="style5">We strive to improve the quality of
mankind through
our teachings and philosophies and reach for goals of improvement in
mind and body.<br />
</p>
<p class="style5"><b></b></p><p class="style5"><b>Karate and Kickboxing Philosophy</b>
</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE - Knowledge of the forms and techniques of our art
and their application regarding self defense.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
SKILL - At each belt level you learn new Karate forms and Kickboxing
techniques.&nbsp; At each successive level you are expected to
perform previously learned forms and techniques with greater skill than
before.&nbsp; All students are evaluated on the basis of their
individual progress.&nbsp; You are not expected to perform better
in comparison to another student, only to be better than you were
before.<br />
<img src="images/bowing.jpg" style="margin: 0px 15px; width: 576px;" alt="Bowing" align="left" /></p>
ATTITUDE - Attitude is one of the most important parts of your
training.&nbsp; Without the proper emphasis on attitudinal
development,
Karate and Kickboxing are little more than organized brawling.<br />
<br />
RESPECT - Gain respect for yourself and learn to treat others with a
sense of regard, value and worthiness.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
COURTESY - To behave kindly, considerately, and positively toward other
people.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
SELF
DISCIPLINE - To overcome the opponent within you, who would lead you
down the paths of laziness and self-aggrandizement, in an attempt to
defeat you.<br />
<br />
CONFIDENT HUMILITY - When confidence in your
knowledge and skill is firm within you and you have no need to prove
yourself to anyone, short of an actual self-defense situation in which
your life or health, or that of a loved one is in jeopardy.<br />

PROTOCOL</span></p>
<p><span class="style2">Everyone
is
required to bow upon entering or exiting the Dojo (training
area).&nbsp; All classes begin and end with a bow, as a sign of
respect.&nbsp; Students entering class late or dismissed early are
also required to bow.&nbsp; All black belts are referred to as
Sensei (meaning Teacher) and must be bowed to upon greeting or
departure. There are no exceptions to this protocol.</span><span class="style1"><br style="line-height: 14px;" />
